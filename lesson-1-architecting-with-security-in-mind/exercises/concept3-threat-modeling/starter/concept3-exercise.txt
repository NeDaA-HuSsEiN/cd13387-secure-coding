Scenario: There are two connected embedded systems. A user can locally log in to one of the systems using user credentials. The logged in user can run some commands on a terminal on the embedded system. That embedded system then communicates over some communication protocol with the other embedded system to perform some physical actions. E.g., a control system is connected to an actuator system. Both embedded systems run some firmware that is responsible for the functionality of the systems. A superuser account exist that can perform firmware updates.
Instructions:
1. Identify the assets in the above scenario.

2. Perform a threat model using STRIDE to identify threats based on the identified assets. Remember that STRIDE stands for:
Spoofing
Tampering
Repudiation
Information Disclosure
Denial of Service
Elevation of Privilege
You do not have to identify a threat for all assets in each category.
