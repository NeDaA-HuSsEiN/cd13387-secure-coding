Many embedded systems are part of critical systems, such as vehicles, aircraft, healthcare, critical infrastructure, etc., that can affect safety.
Thus, due to lack of security or poor security design, cyber attackers may be able to successfully exploit these embedded systems which could have disastrous consequences.
Implementing security as an afterthought, “bolting-on security”, often restricts the type of security solutions that can be applied and could negatively affect the system performance or user experience. Moreover, fixing vulnerabilities after release is very costly.
Therefore, it is recommended to build security into the design from the early stages to ensure that an appropriate security solution can be applied and to follow best practices for secure development.
